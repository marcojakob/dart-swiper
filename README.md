Swiper
================

A touch (and mouse) slider for swiping through images and html.


## Browser Support

Swiper uses 
[hardware-accelerated CSS3 transitions](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/increase-your-sites-performance-with-hardware-accelerated-css) 
for smooth animations. IE9 does not support translate3d and transitions.

The Android Browser is not supported by Dart, so Android users will need to use 
Chrome or Firefox.


### Supported Desktop Browsers

* IE10+
* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari


### Supported Mobile Browsers

* Safari Mobile
* Windows8 IE10+
* Chrome Mobile
* Firefox Mobile
